# PyTorch Zero to Mastery
Welcome to the PyTorch Zero to Mastery repository! This repository contains Jupyter notebooks designed to take you from the basics of PyTorch to advanced deep learning techniques.

Modules
00 - PyTorch Fundamentals
What does it cover?

Many fundamental PyTorch operations used for deep learning and neural networks.
01 -  PyTorch Workflow
What does it cover?

Provides an outline for approaching deep learning problems and building neural networks with PyTorch.
02 - PyTorch Neural Network Classification
What does it cover?

Uses the PyTorch workflow from 01 to go through a neural network classification problem.
03 - PyTorch Computer Vision
What does it cover?

Let’s see how PyTorch can be used for computer vision problems using the same workflow from 01 & 02.
04 - Custom Datasets
What does it cover?

How do you load a custom dataset into PyTorch? Also, we’ll be laying the foundations in this notebook for our modular code (covered in 05).
Future Updates
More modules and notebooks will be added in the future. Stay tuned!
